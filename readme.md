Recreate Stendahls' web at https://www.stendahls.se/ .

Use our live pages as a sketch to start rewriting our web. How far you get, how your result looks and functions does not
matter.

What matters is how you write your code and structure it.

### Goals and tips

- Do our start page first.
- Split the code into components and add structure where the repo needs.
- Write and add structure so that it would be easy for another person to take over your work.
- Stuff should work in major browsers and both on desktop and mobile.
- Hard code everything.
- Copy content from our pages.
- Please feel free to copy code from our pages as well, however code in the repo should be used, easy to read, and make
  sense.

### Do not

- Do not get stuck on polishing.
- Do not get stuck on tooling, ops or deployment.

### Get started

You can find our template repo at https://github.com/stendahls/fe-lia-2024 .

You will need to clone it to your computer by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/stendahls/fe-lia-2024.git
```

Change to the new folder:

```
cd fe-lia-2024
```

Install node packages by running:

```
npm install
```

Start the local dev service by running:

```
npm run dev
```

Then browse to http://localhost:5173/ .

We have created a component for you to help you start out, the Navbar component. It shows you how to structure a
component and also how to use it in the app. You don't _have to_ use the pre-made component, but if you do, note that
the component is not finished, so it's up to you to make it look nicer.<br>
_**Note**_: _the navbar component is not the main focus here, it was simply created to show you the structure of a
component and how to use it. Focus on the whole solution rather than "just" fixing the navbar._

### Instructions for delivery

- When you are finished or the time is up, ZIP the project. Use the naming convention "yourname-StendahlsWebsite" for
  your ZIP file.
- Upload the ZIP at https://forms.monday.com/forms/b1e5df64eb028fb5a615619f230c54a2?r=euc1 .
